  *Note*
  The sturcture is going to get changed time to time, depends on how creative i feel and what i will add to my Portolio. It's a journey not a destination.
  To see changes in short see the Updates section below. ;)

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port Vite specifies).

## Adding Blog Posts

- Add blog post metadata in `src/data/blogPosts.js`.
- Create corresponding blog content components in `src/blogs/` following the existing month-based naming convention (e.g., `MonthX.jsx`).
- Update routing or blog listing pages if necessary.

## Testing

Currently, there are no automated tests included. Manual testing is recommended by navigating through the blog pages and verifying content rendering.
