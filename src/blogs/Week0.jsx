      <p className="mb-6">Hey there, world! 👋</p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Welcome to the first official blog on my brand-new portfolio site. I’m Zayed Binjad — an aspiring AI Engineer with a mission to go from zero to world-class, one week at a time. 🧠⚡
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        This week was all about setting the foundation, and what better way to start than by building my own digital home — this portfolio! It was a journey of late nights, troubleshooting, learning, and a bit of Googling 😅. From deploying it on Vercel, connecting custom domains like .dev, .com, and .in, to styling it all with React and Tailwind CSS — every line of code taught me something new.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">I didn’t do this with a course. No tutorial series. Just me, the docs, some AI assistance, and raw curiosity.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-300 mt-8 mb-4">🧠 What’s Next: Week 1 Learning Plan</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-6 text-gray-300">
        <li>Master Python (variables, loops, functions, OOP)</li>
        <li>Learn NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib basics</li>
        <li>Linear Algebra (vectors, dot product, matrix operations)</li>
        <li>Calculus (derivatives, gradients)</li>
        <li>Probability & Statistics (mean, std dev, distributions)</li>
        <li>Build Python Projects: calculator, matrix ops, CSV analyzer</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-6 text-purple-300 italic">📚 It’s going to be a packed week, but I’m excited — this is the ground zero of something big.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-300 mt-8 mb-4">🔥 Why I’m Doing This</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        AI isn’t just the future — it’s the now. And I’m here to not just learn it, but master it. I’ll be documenting everything I do — honestly, openly, and consistently — so if you’ve ever wanted to learn AI, this might be your sign to start.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-300 mt-8 mb-4">🗓️ See You Next Sunday @ 9 PM!</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        I'll be posting a new blog every Sunday at 9 PM, sharing my progress, challenges, learnings, and projects. If you want to learn with me, or just stay inspired — I’d love to have you on this journey.
      </p>

      <p className="text-purple-400 font-semibold">Until then,<br />Stay curious, stay consistent.<br />— Zayed 💜</p>
